Udacity's cs101 Hints and Answers
=================================

This is a resource for Udacity's CS101 course questions.

Not all the problems have solutions given and none of the problems have hints.
Hopefully we can fix that!

# How to use this resource:

## If you need help with a question:

1. Navigate to the question you are having difficulty with.
2. Look at hints.py if it's available, and try to continue through the problem
   with your new insites
3. If you want to see possible solutions for the question look at solutions.py
4. Try to understand and recreate the given solution (don't just copy and
   paste!)

### Didn't find any hints of solutions for your question?

Bummer! We're working on getting more materials here, but we currently don't
have every exercise covered. Can you help us? Once you find a solution for the
question (check the forums on Udacity, or ask
[stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)) please submit any hints or
solutions you come up with! This is written by the public for anyone to use -
please help us by contributing back!


## If you'd like to submit a hit or solution:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) this repository.
2. Add or make changes to the correct file(s) (`hints.py` or `solutions.py`).
3. Use git to [add](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial/git-basics#!add) and [commit](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial/git-basics#!commit) your changes
4. Run git [push](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial/remote-repositories#!push) to push your changes up to GitHub.
5. Make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) back to this repository.
6. Make any requested changes, and then I'll take it from there!

### Notes for contributers:

1. We do NOT accept pull requests that have deleted another contributer's hint
   or solution without a very clear reason (such as "it doesn't actually pass
   the tests on Udacity").
2. ALL solutions must be clearly documented (please do not submit a solution
   that is just code without explaining why it works).
3. ALL solutions must actually work (please do not submit code that doesn't
   pass Udacity's tests for that question).
4. ONLY use concepts covered in the class (While I'm sure you can
   [code golf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf) with the best of them, the
   point of this repo is for students to understand the covered topics).
5. We happy accept contributions that clarify solutions or hints (you are
   welcome to edit another contributer's submission).
6. We prefer hints to solutions (the goal is for students to get the solution
   on their own, without looking at the supplied solutions).
7. We're not too fussed about exercises that have videos up on the site - if
   you want to supply hints/solutions, great! But we're more interested in the
   "optional" exercises that don't have any solutions supplied.
